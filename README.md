## Other operating systems

Since this application was developed using Electron, it might work on other operating systems. This has not been tested, since Windows and macOS already have dedicated ExpressVPN clients. To test this, clone this project, and run `npm install` and `electron:build` from the project root, from the OS you would like to build it for.
